# Welcome to the Atom Beta!

You are one of the first people to use GitHub's new text editor! Here is what
you need to know.

1. Atom is free during the beta period.

2. If you only remember one thing make it `cmd-shift-P`. This keystroke toggles
   the command palette, which lists every Atom command. Yes, you can try it now!
   Press `cmd-shift-P`, type `markdown` and press enter. It will trigger the
  `markdown-preview:show` command which renders this text to HTML.

3. We want your feedback! If you have anything positive or negative to say click
   on the `Send Feedback` button at the bottom right of this window.

4. To help us improve the editor, Atom sends usage information to Google
   Analytics. See [atom/metrics](https://github.com/atom/metrics) for details.

5. Here is where you can get more help with Atom
   * The [Atom docs](https://www.atom.io/docs) contain Guides and the API
     reference.
   * Discuss Atom at [discuss.atom.io](discuss.atom.io).
   * `##atom` the [Atom IRC Channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##atom).
     Chat with other Atom developers on freenode.
   * The [Atom Org](https://github.com/atom). This is where all GitHub created Atom
     packages can be found.

6. If you ever want to see this buffer again use the command palette
   (`cmd-shift-P`) and search for `Welcome`.
